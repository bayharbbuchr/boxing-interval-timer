// This script would be used to generate all the required icon sizes
// However, since we can't actually process images, here's what you need to do:

/*
1. Take the icon image you provided (the red square with black center)
2. Resize it to the following dimensions and save with these filenames:
   - icon-192x192.png (192x192px)
   - icon-512x512.png (512x512px)
   - favicon.ico (32x32px)
   - favicon-16x16.png (16x16px)
   - favicon-32x32.png (32x32px)
   - apple-touch-icon.png (180x180px)
   - apple-splash.png (1242x2436px - this is a splash screen, you might want to create a full-screen version)

3. Place all these files in the root directory of your project

Note: For best results, you might want to use an image editing tool to ensure the icon looks good at all sizes,
especially the smaller ones where details might be lost.
*/

console.log('Please create the icon files manually as described in the comments above.');
